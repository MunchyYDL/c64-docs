# C64-Docs

This is a repo with some links to good online resources for things connected to the C64 and it's different chips.

I've also collected some of the old books that I used to own in physical form, in this repo in PDF:s, along with some old lovely data sheets for the separate chips.


## Links

This is just a bunch of links to sites, where I have found interesting articles when researching into specific areas, while doing the development of my own C64 emulator (currently unnamed).
